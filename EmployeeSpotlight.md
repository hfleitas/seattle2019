This year was my first year presenting at PASS Summit and I was very lucky to have been selected to speak on 2 sessions. 
The first session was on the Power Platform from Microsoft that includes Power BI, Power Apps and Power Automate for low-code development. This session was received very well based on the feedback from the attendies and had close to 100 people in the room. 
The second session was on Machine Learning to predict the sentiment of a statement in real-time inside the database engine without data movement by using the latest features included in SQL Server Big Data Cluster. This session was good based on the feedback and had approximately 60 people attend.

Furthermore, I worked closely with the Microsoft SQL Server Engineering team on the deployement and security implementation of Spark and Machine Learning features of SQL Server 2019 and Big Data Cluster. I also participated in a focus group meeting regarding the future development of the SQL Assessment API.
